stdio.h is a header file in the C programming language that provides declarations for standard input/output functions. The name "stdio" stands for "standard input/output."
This header file contains function prototypes and macros that allow you to perform input and output operations in your C program. It defines functions such as printf() for formatted output, scanf() for formatted input, getchar() for reading a single character, putchar() for writing a single character, and many others.
Here are some commonly used functions declared in stdio.h:

printf(): Prints formatted output to the standard output stream (usually the console).
scanf(): Reads formatted input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard).
getchar(): Reads a single character from the standard input stream.
putchar(): Writes a single character to the standard output stream.
fopen(): Opens a file for reading or writing.
fclose(): Closes a file.
fread(): Reads data from a file.
fwrite(): Writes data to a file.
fgets(): Reads a line of text from a file or the standard input stream.
fputs(): Writes a line of text to a file or the standard output stream.

To use the functions and macros declared in stdio.h, you need to include this header file at the beginning of your C source file using the #include directive:
cCopy code#include <stdio.h>
This statement tells the compiler to include the contents of the stdio.h header file in your program, allowing you to use the standard input/output functions.
The stdio.h header file is part of the C standard library and is available on all platforms that support C programming. It provides a standardized way to perform input and output operations, making your code portable across different systems.
